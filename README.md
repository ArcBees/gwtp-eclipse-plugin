##Eclipse Requirements
* Kepler or newer.
* Google Eclipse Plugin (GPE) with the GWT features. 
* m2e. I suggest downloading Kepler Java EE, which comes with everything but the GPE plugin. 

###Eclipse Notes
I recommend installing Eclipse Kepler Java EE because it comes with everything but the GPE plugin. 
I also recommend if upgrading from juno that you try kepler out with its own workspace which
can help prevent updating the previous workspace until you are ready. 
If you have any problems with GPE plugin I always recommend creating a new workspace and starting with a fresh
Eclipse install. This prevents many headaches. 

* Note: if you have any problems with Eclipse always try a fresh Eclipse install with a fresh new workspace!

##Download - Update Site
Install the requirements first then the GWTP plugin can be installed by using update site.
